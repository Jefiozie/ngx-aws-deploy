## Installation

We can install `ngx-aws-deploy` on by using the Angular CLI.

    ```bash
    ng add @jefiozie/ngx-aws-deploy
    ```

You will be prompted for a couple of questions:

1. Your AWS Region
2. The bucket you would like the files to be uploaded.
3. The Secret Acces Key
4. The Access key Id

After these step your `angular.json` is update with a new builder:

```json
 "deploy": {
    "builder": "@jefiozie/ngx-aws-deploy:deploy",
    "options": {
    "region": "YOUR REGION",
    "bucket": "YOUR BUCKET",
    "secretAccessKey": "YOUR SECRET ACCESSKEY",
    "accessKeyId": "YOUR ACCES KEY ID"
    }
}
```

Happy deploying! ðŸš€
